SirenSong is a MaxMSP (https://cycling74.com/downloads) based audio manipulation engine to assist with hypnosis and binural beats creation over live audio streams

Run the "TheVoice.maxpat" file after installing MaxMSP; other files are support files or similar experiementations. 

Requires MaxMSP7 and should not require any other libraries or files
   - does require the arduino libraries to be installed, however those are optional and currently unspported demo/trial features
